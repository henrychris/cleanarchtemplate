# CleanArchTemplate

## Description

This is my personal template for projects in C#. It has consistent folder structure, and responses for the API. An editorconfig file is also included. The template mixes the  Architecture with Vertical Slice Architecture.  

## Installation

To use this template, you can clone the repository and use the `dotnet new install .` command in the root folder. After that, you can use the `dotnet new cleanarchtemplate -n YourProjectName` command to create a new project using this template.

## Usage

You can run the project using the `dotnet run` command in the ProjectName.Host folder. The project will be available at `http://localhost:5051`.
Access `http://localhost:5051/swagger` to see the available endpoints.
